''' <summary>
''' This is the class that implements the package exposed by this assembly.
''' </summary>
''' <remarks>
''' <para>
''' The minimum requirement for a class to be considered a valid package for Visual Studio
''' Is to implement the IVsPackage interface And register itself with the shell.
''' This package uses the helper classes defined inside the Managed Package Framework (MPF)
''' to do it: it derives from the Package Class that provides the implementation Of the 
''' IVsPackage interface And uses the registration attributes defined in the framework to 
''' register itself And its components with the shell. These attributes tell the pkgdef creation
''' utility what data to put into .pkgdef file.
''' </para>
''' <para>
''' To get loaded into VS, the package must be referred by &lt;Asset Type="Microsoft.VisualStudio.VsPackage" ...&gt; in .vsixmanifest file.
